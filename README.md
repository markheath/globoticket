# GloboTicket ASP.NET Core Microservices Sample Application

GloboTicket is a sample ASP.NET Core Microservices application that you can learn about in the Pluralsight .NET Microservices Learning path. This path consists of the following courses:

- Microservices: The Big Picture
- Getting Started with ASP.NET Core Microservices
- Microservices Communication in ASP.NET Core
- Implementing a data management strategy for an ASP.NET Core Microservices Architecture
- Securing Microservices in ASP.NET Core
- Versioning and Evolving Microservices in ASP.NET Core
- Deploying ASP.NET Core microservices using Kubernetes and AKS
- Implementing cross-cutting concerns for ASP.NET Core microservices
- Strategies for Microservice Scalability and Availability in ASP.NET Core

### Prerequisites

In order to build and run the sample GloboTicket application, it is recommended that you have the following installed.

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). You can test that you have it installed by entering the command `dotnet --list-sdks`
- [Entity Framework Command Line Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/miscellaneous/cli/dotnet). You can install these as a global tool with the command `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef`
- [SQL Server Express](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/sql-server/editions-and-components-of-sql-server-version-15?view=sql-server-ver15).
- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) (Community Edition or Greater) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Building the Code

You can either load `GloboTicket\GloboTicket.sln` in Visual Studio 2022 and build from within Visual Studio, or from the command line, in the same folder as `GloboTicket.sln`, enter the `dotnet build` command.

### Running the Migrations
Before you run GloboTicket for the first time, you need to run the database migrations for all microservices that have a SQL database. These are the **event catalog** microservice, and the **shopping basket** microservice.

First, navigate into the `GloboTicket\GloboTicket.Services.EventCatalog` folder and run the `dotnet ef database update` command. You might need to run `dotnet tool restore` first.

Then, navigate into the `\GloboTicket\GloboTicket.Services.ShoppingBasket` folder and run the `dotnet ef database update` command.

### Launching Azurite
This demo uses the [Azurite Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite) as the backing for the messaging. Follow the instructions in the Azurite documentation to start it locally.

You may be able to find it already on your machine in the following location:
`C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\Extensions\Microsoft\Azure Storage Emulator\Azurite.exe`

### Running the Application from Visual Studio 2022
You can run the GloboTicket application directly from within **Visual Studio**. To do this, first you have to select each of the three microservices as the startup project and ensure that the start dropdown shows GloboTicket.MicroserviceName (and not **IIS Express**). This will ensure that each microservice runs on the expected ports. 

Then right-click on the solution file and select **Set Startup Projects**, and configure all three projects to either **Start** or **Start without Debugging** as desired. Now, when you run the project from within Visual Studio, all three projects will start up.

### Running the Application from the Command Line
Alternatively, you can run the GloboTicket application from the command line. You will need to open three separate command prompts, one for each `csproj` file. For each project, navigate into the folder containing the `.csproj` file and run the command `dotnet run`.

**Note:** You may be asked to trust the .NET developer certificates. Make sure you do so, in order to use HTTPS to access the services.

### Launch in a browser
If you have followed the instructions, the GloboTicket client application (website) will be running on port 5000, which you can access in the browser at [https://localhost:5000](https://localhost:5000).

The Event Catalog microservice will be running on port 5001 and you can view the API documentation at [https://localhost:5001/swagger](https://localhost:5001/swagger)

The Shopping Basket microservice will be running on port 5002 and you can view the API documentation at [https://localhost:5002/swagger](https://localhost:5002/swagger)
